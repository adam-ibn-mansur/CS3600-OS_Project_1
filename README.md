The objective of the project is to design and develop of a client-server system, which performs classical synchronization problem with a bounded number of resources – clients consume some resources, producers generate resources. The program covers some techniques discussed in the Operating System course:
  • Distributed Client-Server processing;
  • Utilization of threads;
  • Synchronization of concurrent processing;
  • Sockets for network communication;
  • Implementation of Internet application (not Web application) .
