The objective of the project is to design and develop of a client-server system, which performs classical synchronization problem with a bounded number of resources â€“ clients consume some resources, producers generate resources. The program covers some techniques discussed in the Operating System course:

1) Distributed Client-Server processing;
2) Utilization of threads;
3) Synchronization of concurrent processing;
4) Sockets for network communication;
5) Implementation of Internet application (not Web application) .
